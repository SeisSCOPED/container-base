# SCOPED Base Container
This is the base container for SCOPED applications. 

Please reach out to the SCOPED team to have your code added to the list of supported application. You can then receive a badge like this: 

![SCOPED](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://runkit.io/wangyinz/scoped/branches/master/MsPASS)

by replacing the `NAME_OF_YOUR_APP` string and adding the following markdown code to your README file:
```
![SCOPED](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://runkit.io/wangyinz/scoped/branches/master/NAME_OF_YOUR_APP)
```
If you want to turn the badge into a link to the SCOPED container page, you may add the url in the standard markdown syntax:
```
[![SCOPED](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://runkit.io/wangyinz/scoped/branches/master/NAME_OF_YOUR_APP)](https://github.com/SeisSCOPED/container/pkgs/container/NAME_OF_YOUR_APP)
```
